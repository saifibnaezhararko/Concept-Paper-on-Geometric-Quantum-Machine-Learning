One famous problem in BQP is integer factorization (finding prime factors of a large number). 
Classical computers struggle to factor very large numbers efficiently, but a quantum algorithm called 
Shor's Algorithm can factor numbers in polynomial time. This makes BQP highly relevant for fields like cryptography, 
where security is based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.
