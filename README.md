## Can Geometric Quantum Machine Learning Lead to Advantage in Barcode Classification?

I have aimed to present the key concepts from the paper on Geometric Quantum Machine Learning (GQML). I would like to acknowledge and give credit to the authors, Chukwudubem Umeano, Stefano Scali, and Oleksandr Kyriienko, for their excellent work on barcode classification. In the paper, they describe how classical data is converted into binary strings, which are then quantum encoded to transform the binary data into quantum states. These quantum states enable quantum computers to generalize faster than their classical counterparts.
